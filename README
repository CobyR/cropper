G5 Cropper

This is a sample application demonstrating using Paperclip and JCrop to
allow a user to upload and modify an image, and then recrop as needed.

This assumes you are using RVM.

It was created using rails 3.0.3 and Ruby 1.9.2

Clone the repository.

change to the directory
do gem install bundler
do bundle install
do rake db:migrate
do rackup

hit localhost:9292 and have fun.

Couple of NOTES:

  Sorry this was a spike, tests are non-existant.

  Due to an issue with Rails 3 and Paperclip not loading Paperclip
    plugins properly from the lib\paperclip_processor directory, 
    so rather than trying to hack any of that I threw it in the
    config/initializers directory instead.

  Paperclip processor is in config/initializer/cropper.rb
